To resolve the issue, consider using a different approach to achieve the desired layout. One possible solution is to avoid using `calc()` with `vh` and percentages in the same expression. Instead, you could rely on viewport units only or use a JavaScript solution to dynamically adjust the height.

Here's an example using `vh` units:

```css
.container {
  width: 50%;
  height: 80vh; /* Adjust the percentage as needed */
}
```

This solution sets the container's height to 80% of the viewport height, offering a simpler and more reliable approach in most scenarios.
